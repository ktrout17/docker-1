# Launch an nginx container, available on Docker Hub, as a background task. It
# should be named overlord, be able to restart on its own, and have its 80 port
# attached to the 5000 port of Char. You can check that your container functions
# properly by visiting
# http://<ip-de-char>:5000 on your web browser.

winpty docker run -d -p $(docker-machine ip Char):5000:80 --name overlord --restart=always nginx

# -d -> detached
# -p -> publish (port on vm : local port)
# to stop -> docker stop overlord
# to remove -> docker container rm overlord
# to check restart policy -> docker inspect -f {{.HostConfig.RestartPolicy}} overlord
